## Project Planning

### Project Goals

- Produce an algorithm that can determine if a given news article is fake.

### Project Description

- We acquired nearly 50,000 records of real and fake news articles from Kaggle. After come cleaning and feature engineering... 



### Initial Questions

1. Is there an articulable and/or quantifiable difference between a fake news article and a real one?
2. Can we use sentiment analysis to help detect fake news?
3. Is there a significant difference in word count between fake and real news articles?
4. Are there common words (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc.) in fake news articles that do not appear in real articles?
